# Interview task: Graph-less MLP
Are MLPs can successfully distill graph information and outperform GNN with much faster inference?

# Solution is in the file GLNN_solution.pdf

#To run expirements described in solution use one of the "python model_select_experiment.py", "python dropout_experiment.py", "python mlp_2_layers.py"
